# 🚄 Trains vs 🚗 Cars: Which Is Safer?

Overall, **trains are much safer than cars** — both in terms of accident rates and fatalities per mile traveled.

---

## 🚗 Cars
- **Fatalities:** In the U.S., car travel causes roughly **12–15 deaths per billion passenger-miles**.  
- **Risk factors:** Human error, speeding, distracted driving, and road conditions all contribute.  
- **Frequency:** Car crashes happen every few seconds nationwide, though most are minor.

## 🚆 Trains
- **Fatalities:** Passenger train travel averages around **0.5 deaths per billion passenger-miles**, often from rare large incidents or people being on tracks illegally (not passengers).  
- **Risk factors:** Derailments and collisions are rare, and safety systems (like automatic braking and signaling) reduce risks.  
- **Reliability:** Statistically, traveling by train is **20–30 times safer** than by car per mile traveled.
